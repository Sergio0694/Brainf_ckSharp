## Trivia üìñ

This project was the one I used to prototype and develop both the [`CommunityToolkit.Mvvm`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Mvvm/) and [`CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance/) packages, which are heavily used in the projects in this repository.

If you'd like to learn more on these libraries:

- See our samples and docs on the MVVM Toolkit at [aka.ms/mvvmtoolkit](https://aka.ms/mvvmtoolkit)
- See the docs on the HighPerformance package [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/high-performance/introduction)
